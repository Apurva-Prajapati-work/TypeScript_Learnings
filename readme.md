## Introduction
TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, providing better tooling and scalability. This repository will serve as a personal log of my progress and discoveries as I learn TypeScript.

## Why TypeScript?
- Enhances JavaScript with static typing.
- Improves code quality and maintainability.
- Offers better development tools and debugging capabilities.
- Popular in modern web development.

## Getting Started
Since this is my first day learning TypeScript, I plan to:
1. Understand what TypeScript is and why it is used.
2. Set up a basic TypeScript environment.
3. Write my first TypeScript program.

## Future Plans
- Dive deeper into TypeScript features like types, interfaces, and classes.
- Explore how TypeScript integrates with frameworks like React and Node.js.
- Build small projects to practice and solidify my understanding.

Stay tuned as I update this repository with my learnings!
